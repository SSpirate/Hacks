# :star: **WHAT IS IPL AUCTION**
       The IPL auction is the event by which the eight IPL teams recruit new players for the competition.
## :star: **HOW IT WORKS**:
- Each of the eight teams are given a budget of 85 crores (roughly   £9.3m) to fill up their squads with a maximum of 25 players.
       
- Before the auction begins, the teams are given an opportunity to retain the players that they would like to keep from last season.
- The budget that remains after the retention process is then spent during the auction.
- Each of the 332 players available at the auction have set themselves a base price – a price at which the bidding will be opened for them.
- The players have been grouped by their speciality, with batsmen, all-rounders, wicket-keepers, fast bowlers and spinners being auctioned separately.
- Each squad is restricted to a maximum of eight overseas players
